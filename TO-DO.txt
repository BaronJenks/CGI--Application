* Decouple CGI.pm from CGI::Application via encapsulation.

==============

* Provide a means through which cgiapp_prerun() can be used to 
change the run-mode.

Possibly propagate the run-mode to a paramater ('CGIAPP_RUNMODE'), 
and then re-load run-mode from that parameter after cgiapp_prerun()
has been called.

This would allow behaviors to be "stacked".
