TO-DO: Future additions to CGI::Application
===============================================

"I have a suggestion for the CGI::App dump function. I suggest added
the run mode called to the output. Yes, it must originate somewhere
from the query or the environment info, but it would be nice to
reality check the function that was actually called, once the
application got through parsing it."  -- Mark Stosberg
