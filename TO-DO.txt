> line near the top of the module that says:
> 
>     use CGI::Carp;
> 
> to just:

> CGI::Application doesn't necessarily use CGI.pm (you can pass a 
> different type of "CGI" object to new() via the QUERY 
> parameter), so it 
> shouldn't necessarily use CGI::Carp either.
> 
> If users want to use CGI::Carp in their CGI applications then 
> they can 
> easily put "use CGI::Carp;" in their application superclass.
